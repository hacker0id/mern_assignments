#1 : URL?
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, as the name suggests it helps locate a resource on the web.
URL has parts like protocol:domain:port
Protocol tells the browser what it needs (request, HTTP/HTTPS) and domain tells the address (where to look),
The port is by default not visible and is 80 in value.
Path can be a associated with a domain.
Examples : 

https://www.sadajuta.com --> https protocol , www.google.com domain.

http://www.sadajuta.com/products --> /products is path here.



#2: HTTPS vs HTTPS
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols 
used for transferring data over a network, but they differ in terms of security.

HTTPS used SSL(secure sockets layer | depricated) / TLS(transport layer security | latest) for encryption of data where as there is no security in http which makes
the data vulnerable to attacks like MITM.

HTTP uses port 80
HTTPS uses port 443

#3 DOM?
Document Object Model is what reacts to the changes on a web page.
It defines a tree like structre where nodes and inter nodes are present.
It can be manipulated using a Scripting Language like JS, JS can access and changes the elements
of a webpage using DOM.
It is standardized by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).


#4 Meta Tags : 
Meta tags are tags that provide the metadata of the webpage.
They convey info to the web broswers and search engines.
They are ignored by the Rendering Engines and don't display any visual content.

Ex: 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
is used in responsive web pages to give info about the view port and scaling etc.


#5 W3C
World Wide Web Consortium is international community that standardizes characteristics for the better
development of the web. They standardize characteristics for HTML CSS JS etc.
They basically set the rules.
